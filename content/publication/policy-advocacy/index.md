abstract: On January 7th, 2016, New York became the 23rd state to roll out a medical marijuana program. The program's start has been underscored by a growing recognition about the lack of patient access and the state's lukewarm response to addressing the numerous barriers severely ill patients face in trying to access life-saving medicine. This report provides a systematic overview of the program's problems and an evaluation of possible solutions. The report also details the lack of systematic data on various aspects of the program, which poses a significant challenge to program assessment and policy recommendation. Our two main recommendations are the passage of four bills that would significantly improve patient access and a listing of data measure that would assist policymakers and advocates in generating solutions to various problems associated with the program.
