abstract: The Research and Evaluation Center partnered with Osborne Association to evaluate a program aimed to improve relationships between formerly incarcerated fathers and their children using a family-centered approach. The research teamâ€™s findings suggest Prepare was successful in helping individuals reconnect with their children and families and obtaining employment. Participants had almost universally positive things to say about Prepare. Feedback included high levels of satisfaction with the services, information, and support they received from the program.
