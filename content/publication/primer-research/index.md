abstract: As a Tow Policy Advocacy Fellow at DPAâ€™s inaugural Department of Research and Academic Engagement, I collaboratively developed a primer on reading research which synthesizes best practices and guidelines on how to approach reading and evaluating academic studies. In our highly politicized world of criminal justice and drug policy reform, it is imperative for advocates, reformers and other stakeholders to be able to discern high-quality research from 'junk' or pseudoscience.
