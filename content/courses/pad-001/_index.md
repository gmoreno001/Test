### *Compassionate Care New York Policy Advocacy Report*


{{% staticref "media/Policy_Advocacy_Final.pdf" "newtab" %}}**This report**{{% /staticref %}} was prepared to fulfill the requirements of the Policy Advocacy Practicum, a two-semester practicum course that includes modules on: Policy Analysis, Communication, Leadership & Social Change, Research Methods, and Political Awareness. 

This classroom-based training supported my 9-month, 14 hour/week Fellowship placement at the Drug Policy Alliance, a dynamic organization engaged in cutting-edge advocacy work at the intersection of drug policy reform and social justice. The placement provided context and real-world substance to classroom instruction.
