### About the Class

This course provides an understanding of the principles and concepts of using computer tools for data analysis and visualization. Students will learn to use a programming language (SAS and R) to wrangle and analyze data, and statistical modeling techniques will be introduced. Written reports will prepare students for clear communication of their analysis in professional settings.
