title: Mayor's Action Plan (MAP) Outcome Evaluation
---

Launched in 2014, the Mayor's Action Plan (MAP) for Neighborhood Safety is a comprehensive initiative focused on the safety and well-being of residents living in 15 public housing communities, operated by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), which have been disproportionately affected by crime in recent years. 

The outcome evaluation of MAP focused on understanding the effects of the initiative and identifying outcome differences between MAP communities and a matched set of comparison NYCHA communities. Using administrative and survey data, researchers at JohnJayREC tested relationships between various efforts of MAP and key outcomes expected to result from those efforts. Results were documented and shared in a series of [Evaluation Update reports](https://johnjayrec.nyc/category/work-products-by-project/nyc-mayors-action-plan/).
