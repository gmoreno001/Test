I am currently a Senior Research Analyst at the [Research and Evaluation Center at John Jay College](https://johnjayrec.nyc/), where I work on projects related to examining, measuring and evaluating the impact of various innovations in justice policy and practice. 

Having recently graduated in 2020, I am not in school at the moment but consider myself a forever learner. Over the years, my college fellowships and academic career have shaped my research interests which lie at the intersection of justice policy reform and data analysis. 

On a less serious note, I enjoy trying out recipes and documenting my successes and failures on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/139043990@N02/albums) (though I am not into photography aspect of it). 

Feel free to reach out or connect with me!
