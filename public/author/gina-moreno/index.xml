      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gina-m.rbind.io/publication/op-ed-sept16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Gov. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesunion.com/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=tuplus-opinion&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Andrew&amp;#43;Cuomo%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; announced his office will sign off on recommendations in the state &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesunion.com/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=tuplus-opinion&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Health&amp;#43;Department%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Health Department&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s recent two-year report evaluating the rollout and status of New York&amp;rsquo;s medical marijuana program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was encouraging to see the Health Department recommend a series of much-needed changes to improve the program, advocates were disappointed with the lengthy time frames and noncommittal language. Without immediate change, New York&amp;rsquo;s program continues to fail countless patients that could benefit from having access to medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Health Department announced it will be undertaking a review of the evidence on the medical use of marijuana for chronic pain, with no guarantee that it will be included as a qualifying condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that states with medical marijuana laws have fewer opioid overdose deaths and lower prescription drug use, which should provide the impetus and urgency to embrace medical marijuana. Other states have taken heed, and recently Minnesota and Vermont added intractable pain and chronic pain as qualifying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 10 qualifying conditions, New York&amp;rsquo;s program excludes thousands of patients who could obtain much-needed relief from medical marijuana. Regrettably, the Health Department made no mention of other severe, debilitating conditions, like PTSD, for which there is a growing body of scientific evidence attesting to the efficacy of medical marijuana as part of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly need. A survey conducted by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesunion.com/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=tuplus-opinion&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Drug&amp;#43;Policy&amp;#43;Alliance%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Drug Policy Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Compassionate Care New York in June found that 35 percent of patients who did not qualify for medical marijuana in New York reported suffering from PTSD. Adding PTSD and other conditions that affect thousands of New Yorkers should be a clear next step for the health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome the DOH&amp;rsquo;s decision to allow nurse practitioners to certify patients, given that an alarming 27 counties across the state have zero registered physicians, or just one. Beyond that step, advocates call on the Health Department and the Cuomo administration to address the problem of locating a registered physician to obtain a medical marijuana certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York, there is no publicly accessible list of participating doctors â a significant hurdle to patients seeking access to medication. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesunion.com/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=tuplus-opinion&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22DPA%2FCCNY%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DPA/CCNY&lt;/a&gt; survey found that more than half of eligible patients had not yet found a doctor to certify them; among them, 60 percent have spent three to four months trying to locate a registered physician. The Health Department should immediately eliminate this front-end barrier to treatment by publicizing a list of participating health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 7,000 patients may be registered with the program, it is unclear how many have been able to purchase and consistently access medicine. Since the program&amp;rsquo;s launch, many news reports have drawn attention to how costly medicine is for the average patient, who has to pay out of pocket (since insurance does not cover the cost of medical marijuana). Our survey found that, of the patients who had purchased medicine, 77 percent said they would not be able to afford the monthly cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For New York&amp;rsquo;s program to succeed, medications should be comparably priced with products available in other states. Additional brands and administration methods should also be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is encouraging to see the Health Department commit to implementing these changes. This is a pivotal moment for New York to reaffirm its commitment to providing access to compassionate medical care. If implemented, the changes have the potential to expand patient access to treatment and relief.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ease access to medical marijuana</title>
      <link>https://gina-m.rbind.io/publication/op-ed-feb16/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gina-m.rbind.io/publication/op-ed-feb16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month marked the historic launch of New York&amp;rsquo;s medical marijuana program. Years of political wrangling and tireless advocacy have led up to this long-awaited moment when patients in New York will finally be able to legally purchase medical marijuana, including an unprecedented offering of kosher-certified medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers have worked for five months to meet the ambitious deadline set by Gov. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesunion.com/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=tuplus-opinion&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Andrew&amp;#43;Cuomo%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, and the state has ensured that the implementation of the program follows the letter of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has it done enough to ensure patient access to compassionate medical care? What should be a momentous moment for patients, including those who have tirelessly advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana, is instead marked by more uncertainty and further delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to medical marijuana treatment is contingent on whether doctors are already trained and registered to recommend it to qualified patients. Scores of patients however, have noted that their doctors are resistant to even considering medical marijuana as a form of legitimate treatment. Physicians, many being naturally conservative, seem reluctant to separate the stigma from the science. Their reluctance is compounded by marijuana&amp;rsquo;s federal classification as an illegal substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors should rest assured, however. New York&amp;rsquo;s program offers robust legal protection, and doctors in 22 other states have been offering medical marijuana to their patients without interference from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether they intend to recommend it, doctors should expect inquiries from patients, so they need to be adequately informed in order to provide the best possible medical care. By refusing to even consider medical marijuana, physicians are depriving patients of their right to explore a treatment that could work for them. Patients, frustrated from having to wait and in desperate need of pain relief, will likely resort to marijuana sold on the street, which, besides being of questionable quality and illegal, thoroughly defeats the purpose of establishing a medical marijuana program. The best way to ensure patient safety is to have as many trained and registered doctors as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other significant barriers could potentially thwart access for New York&amp;rsquo;s neediest patients. Those who qualify for treatment run the real risk of being excluded from the program simply because they live too far from a dispensary or cannot afford treatment. Even 20 dispensaries up and running would not be enough to cover a state of nearly 20 million people over 54,000 square miles. For instance, the only two dispensaries serving eight counties in Western New York are located in Amherst. This places a harsh burden on patients, many of whom are disabled and low income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, medical marijuana treatment is not covered by any insurance carrier, and details on financial assistance remain discouragingly sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, due to a limited number of qualifying conditions, many New Yorkers will be excluded from accessing potential medical relief despite compelling evidence of marijuana&amp;rsquo;s efficacy for treating a number of serious conditions like PTSD and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiences from 22 other states offer valuable lessons that should galvanize New York to avert similar problems regarding patient access. For parents with children suffering from life-threatening seizures, imagine learning that your child will have to continue waiting for access to lifesaving medication that has proven beneficial to hundreds of patients in other states. For these children, any delay could be life threatening. As patients continue to wait, many are questioning the state&amp;rsquo;s commitment to providing fair and equitable access to compassionate medical care, a commitment undertaken by the commissioner himself shortly after the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law. We hope New York&amp;rsquo;s medical marijuana program can soon deliver on this noble promise.&lt;/p&gt;
